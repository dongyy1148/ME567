        <h2 class="h1">1. Result for A-star algorithm.</h1>
        <img width=40% src="A-star.png">
        <img width=40% src="A-2.png">
        <h3 class="h1">Based on the plots, we can see that A-star's advantage is that the designed path is always the 
            shortest path. However, the searched range is relatively large to ensure the algorithm will always find the 
            shortest path.</h1>

        <h2 class="h1">2. Result for greedy-best-first algorithm.</h1>
        <img width=40% src="greedy.png">
        <img width=40% src="g-2.png">
        <h3 class="h1">Based on the plots, we can see that greedy-best-first's advantage is that it will approach 
            the goal point very quickly when there is no obstacle between start and goal point, which will have much 
            fewer searched points. However, if there is obstacle between them, the search path may turn to totally wrong
            direction like the second plot showed, which will increase the search range. Besides, the designed path is not always 
            the shortest path, which will depend on the search priority.</h1>
        
        <h2 class="h1">3. Result for depth-first algorithm.</h1>
        <img width=40% src="depth-first.png">
        <img width=40% src="d-2.png">
        <h3 class="h1">Based on the plots, we can see that depth-first's search algorithm totally depends on the serach priority 
            we design. If the priority is not suitable, it will increase the search range like the plots. Besides, the designed path 
            is usually not the shortest path.</h1>
        
         <h2 class="h1">4. Result for breadth-first algorithm.</h1>
        <img width=40% src="breadth-first.png">
        <img width=40% src="b-2.png">
        <h3 class="h1">Based on the plots, we can see that greedy-best-first's advantage is that the designed path
            will always be the shortest path. However, breadth-first algorithm's search range is the largest among 
            four algorithms as the plots showed since it will search all the points layer by layer.</h1>
